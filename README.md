SFJ
===

SFJ is two things:

*	*black_label* - A set of support libraries
*	*cave_demo* - A demo application

The latter is used to showcase the former. Right now, however, 
neither is very functional. Why not have a look at what actually works
thus far such as the [thread_pool](https://github.com/frederikaalund/sfj/blob/master/black_label/libraries/thread_pool/test/test_1.cpp)!
